## Forward modeling of 3D gravity anomalies using high-order Gaussian quadrature

[Chinese ](./document/README.md) |  [Document](https://gauss-quadrature-3d-gravity.vercel.app/)

This program calculates the gravity anomalies generated in the horizontal plane by a cuboid gravity anomaly model with given parameters.

**It is recommended that you use a version no later than MATLAB 2019b.**
